# Modem Utilities

An assorted collection of retrocomputing utilities.

## X-Modem

Uploads a file to the distant end using the XModem protocol.

**STATUS:** It works and I use it regularly with a USB RS-232 adapter on Windows 3.1.

```
env FILE=placeholder.png ruby xmodem.rb
```

## Dial-In

Pretend that your laptop is a 90's era dialup ISP. Useful for when you want to fire up IE 5.

**STATUS:** Gets you to the 3rd party auth screen of IE5 (Shiva dialer, really) and then crashes.
